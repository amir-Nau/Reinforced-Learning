# Reinforced-Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Safe state abstraction in reinforcement learning allows an
agent to ignore aspects of its current state that are irrelevant to its current decision, and therefore speeds up dynamic programming and learning. In this repository we will explore our understanding of RL.
